        <h2>Amazing natural wonders of the world: Mount Everest</h2>
        <p>The Mount Everest is the tallest mountain above sea level with a whopping height of 8,848 m and is a part of the greater Himalayan range, on the border of China and Nepal. Though formed about 60 million years ago, there is evidence of underwater sedimentary rocks that are over 400 million years old. Research proves that the Indian subcontinent was an independent island when it clashed with Asia, gradually forming the Everest. This is also the reason why the mountain keeps growing taller (by 4 mm) each year. The height of this mountain has been a matter of debate for both China and Nepal for the longest time.</p>
